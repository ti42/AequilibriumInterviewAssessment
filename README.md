Bdd Project

1)This Project is a maven project so all you have to do is downloand or pull it with your ide. You do not need to install anything as the 
pom.xml file does it for you.

2)Make sure to check out DriverFactory class in Utilities folder inside the test directory. It is based on a singleton design pattern to 
create only one instance. It is used to overcome Webdriver issue in cucumber projects to run parallel testing (Thread Local is the key).
